# DeepLearning Final Project


**This repository is the code for the final group project of NYU DS-GA 1008 Deep Learning class, taught by Yann LeCun.**

*Team member: Jiayi Du, Meiyi He, Ziyu Lei (**DHL**)*


1. starter_files: The files provided by instructors. 
2. hrnet: Predict binary road map using HRNets (High-resolution Networks). 
3. yolo: Predict bounding boxes using YOLO network. 
4. pretrain: AutoEncoder for pretraining on unlabeled data. 
5. submission: Since it's a competition, we have 3 rounds of submissions. 
6. visualization: Visualize the predictions made by trained models. 
7. archived: some legacy code.

**Given input images (captured by 6 cameras mounted on ego car):**
